## 💃🏻 Introduction
👩🏻‍🚀 Originally designed for the U.S. Department of Defense, Ada was designed with three overriding concerns: 
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Program reliability</b> and <b>maintenance</b>, such as in <i>The Military</i>. </li>
        <li> Programming as a <b>human</b> activity, 
          such as in <i>Engineering multi-team cross-field projects</i>. </li>
        <li><b>Efficiency</b>, such as in <i>Aerospace Control Systems</i>.</li>
      </p>
    <p>
        👩🏻‍🚒 Ada has gained a reputation as being the language of choice when software <b>needs</b> to be correct.
