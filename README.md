Learning Pourpose Code for Ada Language.
Most of the code is related to my classes in Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC)
But it's all originall content, made by me (Julio Toboso)
The pourpouse is to complement and go through the concepts studied in class.

The Code is BeerFree: If you use it, I'd apreciate a beer.
Also allowed to share and reuse for educational pourposes.
